Creative Project 2


For this to work, I used Amazon Lex.
It was inspired by one of the previous assignments I did with Marti when generating story descriptions/ prompts.
This project is meant to help assist a writer in creating Characters, Prompts, Settings, Sidekicks, and Endings.
The random generation creates numerous surpising combinations that can allow a spark of inpiration for the users when they are writing.
It is also great for creating exercise prompts that allow users to stretch their writing skills but  pushing them out of their comfort zone.
This code can also be easily added to and edited to allow for more random and updated ideas to explore new combinations and story ideas.

This can also make an incredible tool for creative writing courses, to provide warm up prompts, characters, and settings (etc). 
When I was in undergrad, in the creative writing course, the prompts seemed too familiar to one another, with this generator, it can create inventive prompts as well as add the different portions of the story (characters, setting, sidekick, and ending). This can be beneficial in challeging the students by giving them different characters under the same prompt or other same-to-different combinations. 

The called upon phrases include:

Place one of these words in place of the "...": (character, setting, prompt, sidekick, and ending)


"Help me create a ..." 

"Another..."

"Create a ..."




Note: I thought I had this working but when I went back to check it it kept giving response as thought "Return parameters to client" under "Fullfillment" the editing portion of the bot. I checked and edited and toyed with the code trying to fix it but I have yet to find a conclusion to my problem, may end up contacting you, Prof, Monday to explain issues.
