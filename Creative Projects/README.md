## **Generated Text Project**
Originally I wanted to create an Alchemy novel based using a science book and a basic magic book. I had some trouble finding the books/ files I wanted for this idea. 
I played around with some other idea and landed on recipes, inspired by Zach Walden and his Marxist Recipes in the first Exercise,
but alas I could not pick another topic/ book to combine with recipes.
Then while working on my thesis studio project, which is based on the greek mythical being Medusa, I came up with an interesting prospect. 
Greek Mythology and History
What would it be like if the gods, goddesses, monsters, and heroes were a part of modern history?

_note:_
_this current file is a draft, it will be updated as I play with the code and edit some of the text files._
