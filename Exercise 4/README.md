**Exercise 4: Create an Interactive Voice Application**

Created by: Brieana Perez, John Herman, and Marti Allen

We created our chatbot around the idea of entertainment: Books, Anime, and Video Games. 
Wherein the user can ask the chatbot what to read, watch, or play and it pulls from a supplied list of each perspective entertainment.

The suggested queries are:

"I want to watch an anime"

"Give me a name of a book"

"Name a video game"

All of these can be exchanged with another entertainment type and the verb that is most appropiate with the entertainment type, i.e. read is to book, watch is to anime, play is to video game.

Should the user wish for another suggestion of a book, anime, or video game they can just use the phrase, "another [entertainment type]"
